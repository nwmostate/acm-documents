Hello!
Next Wednesday ACM is having a hack-a-thon kickoff.
A hack-a-thon is a design sprint in order to solve the given problem.
You will be given one week to design OR code a Covid contact tracing process.
Everyone is welcome to join the hackathon.
The Hackathon can be done in a small team or solo.
The winning process may be used for spring Covid contact tracing. 
The winning team will receive a tee shirt and a gift card.
(Please note that a combination of processes, ideas and solutions presented, including those that do not win, may be used in the final contact tracing process used by the University)
The kick off meeting will be Wednesday September 16 at 5pm.
In this meeting we will fully explain the problem and write down teams. This is the best time to ask questions and gather more information.
Next week Wednesday September 23 at 5pm, all the teams will present their solutions to the judges and a winner will be decided.
All these meetings will be on Zoom. Link below.
If you can not make it to the kickoff just email me and I will send you the information after the kickoff is over. 
You do have to come to the presentation. Attendance for the presentation day is mandatory. Only you know your project well enough to tell the judges about it.
Let me know if you have any questions or issues with the Zoom link my email is 

Hope you will come and design something amazing,
ACM Executive Board
