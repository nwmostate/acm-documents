Hackthon idea is a faculty schedule generator. This schedule will be a combination of the facultys office hours and class
schedule. Since we want to appeal to all we will do protyping not coding. We will provide the protyping website.
Connor will message faculty and see who will come. THe faculty will walk around and help teams by anwsering questions.
We will provide snacks and drinks. They will be the left over snacks from the gamethon.
