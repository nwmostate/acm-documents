Finally Connor plans to email Faculty about beeing the aid for our hackthon and if we could come in to their classes and talk
about our upcoming events.
For regular board member they need to fill out the when2meet for the orgization fair so we make  schedule for when who is
going to be at the table
Addi will make gamethon/gamejam poster
Veify we have the building and notify the police for Gamethon

---Planning for Hackthon----
Hackthon will be in CH 3600 during our normal meeting time.This will be our kickoff event.
How it will work is we will have teams of students with a professor work on a problem. 
If we do no get enough professors we will have teams of students with the abilty to ask professors for help 
when they get stuck. The refresments for this event will be the leftover snacks from the last gamethon.

--Planning for Gamjam and gamethon---
We need to buy prizes for gamejam. Prize ideas were Giftcard for steam or humble bundle asset pack or 
retro game machine or 3d print trophies. The prizes would go to Popular vote, Most fitting to theme and Judge's pick.
Gamethon will be 16 hours long this time and still be 15 dollars and same about of food. How gamejam will work is it free they 
are free to work in the mac lab but after presentation(6pm) they will have to leave. Braclets for gamejam so show they will
not be eatting. Badges for everyone else to show they are eatting. Connor and his team will present their game while the 
judges are judging. Talk to Esports club.

--Finance--
End with about 900 dollars
