This would fall the week after spring break and nobody wanted to work the table. The idea was droped. 
For the gamethon we need to buy new snacks and plan pizza.We will use the information from last semester.
The alfrado pizza was a big hit so we will buy more of that. Since last year acm had to kick people out at 
2am this year we are extending the hours to 12pm to 5am. We will be raffeling off a ticket again but we need to find a sponsor.

Gamejam:
Game jam kick off is March 19th. we need to reserve a room for that event. There was a notion to push back the Gamejam judging
to 8pm. Since we are asking professors to judge it is only fair. The notion was suspended till the judges are asked which time
they prefer. We need to email judges then. HOw gamejam members are going to work is they are welcome to come for the juding but
thats it unless they buy a badge.

pass for help. The help will last 5 mins and they have to turn in the pass once they ask a queestion. We will have prizes
2nd and 3rd github stickers will win github sticker and 1st will win $5 starbucks or gamethon badge.
For this event we will just send out an email blast and not make posters since it is a smaller event and bring up gameathon
snacks.
