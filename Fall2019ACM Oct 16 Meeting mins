Next year notes.
We are all registering before next exec meeting so next exec meeting we alter the ACM meeting time to best fit all our new schedules.  We have decided the winter election date of the week of Jan 27-31. That way the new board will be able to plan the field trip and the next gamethon.
Gamethon notes.
Make handouts of gamethon and ACM posters to handout at Colden ticket selling(Nov 4-8). We thought it would be a good idea for teacher to hand out these fliers as well. The spot we are selling ticket in Colden is upstairs in the foyer. We still have 33 attendee badges to sell we have sold 17. We would be in a good place if we can sell three more. In the evening we have been going to esports club to sell badges. They will join us on Thursday and Friday of the first week we are selling tickets. For poster we still decided to have posters hung up around Colden hall about 25 and we will hang these up the week before we sell in Colden. We have called around about pizzas and decided dominos 7 dollars large was the best deal. We will end up spending 210 for 30 pizzas 10 pepperoni, 10 cheese, 5 sausage and maybe 5 Alfaro but will have to call and ask if that is part of the deal.
Bank account notes
We will be making our new bank account after gamethon and our starting money will be from the vennmo and money box
