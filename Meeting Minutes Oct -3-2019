Gamethon Notes
  Esports has a tourment on the orginal date we had gamethon. Since they bring alot of people to gamethon we will move gamethon to accomdate them. The options was November 2nd or November 9th. Novermber 2nd is a home game and do to parking we decided no to move gamethon to that day. The other option is Novemeber 9th which is Mick Wix. Since Mick Wix only is talke a small group we decided to go ahead and hold gamethon that weekend.
  Esports club brought up the comment that people thought it was silly to pay twice. Once to get into the event and again to get into the smash tourment. An idea was brought up to have Smash Bundle. These bages would be marked with a sticker or hole punch. Due to tracking money and keeping ACM money seperate from esports club it was decided not to do a bundle. But they would join us during the union presale to sell entry in to smash tourment and they would use stickers to mark who paid to get into the event.esports club also was going to set up Smash at the union booth. It was brought up to have other tourments besides smash or have a causal smash tourment or event streaming the tourments. We decided to leave these decisions up to esports club.
  Since we are selling badges in the union three weeks early we decided it might be a good idea to talk to someone about selling badges in colden. If we can't we might try selling badges in the open lab. We need to adversite both these weeks in classes. 
We have from previous gamethons is plates, utils and napkins. To make the snacks last we need to keep an eye on snack to make sure people are just taking them to eat at the event not to eat later.
Poster for gamethon. It was brought up to make tiny poster and hand them out. We decided not to go ahead with that idea. we did decided to try to hang up poster in Volk, Colden and Garett-Strong. Since we are not sure how well the union bulliton did we decided not to do that bulliton board but just have one big poster for the table.
