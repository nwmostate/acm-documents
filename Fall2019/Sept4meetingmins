After pie a professor we have 720 dolllars in the bank.
Talk to rapid about buying a table cloth or/ banner for next organization fair.
Should we take out commitees of constitution? - leave it for now due to uncertain membership
we are fully complience to ACM
-----------------------------------------------KICKOFF REVIEW---------------------------------------------------
Pie a Professor was a good fundrasier for us and we definitly want to do it again next year. This year we made 100is dollars.
The professors had alot of fun but a suggestion they had for next  year was they wanted to pie students as well. For next year
we need to buy googles for the professors, remember to bring towels and this year we ought 13 can of whipped cream and we ran out.
---------------------------------------------ORGANIZATION FAIR REVIEW--------------------------------------------
The email list we created at the orgation fair. We need to scan it in and put it on github.

ELoe is working on coming up on a list of all the students who did intership for credit this summer. This event is next week on
11th. This event which is in the pac lobby (marshmellow building). We have the lobby reserved from 4pm to 9pm. The evnt is at 630. Eloe would love for the exec board to help him hang poster at 430 and take down at the end of the event. This night is only about intership poster not research posters. We need to send an email about this event.
----------------------------------------------------EA SPEAKER-----------------------------------------------------
Dr.Hoot is offering a Q&A session with a Esports game designer. This Q&A is on sept 18 at 3pm. If you know anyone that is intrested let Dr.Hoot know. 
----------------------------------------------------GAMEATHON-------------------------------------------------------
This years theme is Tron. Ten percent of our porfits is going to go to extra life. In the next two weeks we need to lock down sponors. If there is not enough sponors by the 20th we will drop having sponorships. We could ask ACM for a sponorship and the school for a donation. A question came up is will student affairs have a problem with having adversisment for other companies on our gamethon poster. The awnser is no do to the fact the we have seen other posters have ads on them. Last gamethon we had a big poster in the union. This poster was all black and cost us about 18 dollors to have printed. We belive that this was very sucessful. We hope to put this big poster out a week before we start doing sales in to union. For badges we will order 15 staff and 45 general. To avoid running out of staff badges this year we will make a list of all the staff and if you are not on the list you will not get a staff badge. We need to talk to esports club about our event and get a staff count from them and a head count from them. For selling badges it is 15 for preorder and 20 at the door and we decided that all sales are final.We need to remember to bring the money box to the union and keep track of how many we sell. Gamethon will starts at noon and ended at 2am but we will have colden for 1030 to 3am. We will lock the mac room from the whole event. We also need to make sure to put all the rooms back the way we found them after the gamethon. Fom last year we have napkins,trash bags, and lanyards. Last year we had twon rounds with having less pizzas for lunch and more pizzas for dinner with a total of 45 pizzas.
