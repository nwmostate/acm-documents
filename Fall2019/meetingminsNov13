Gamethon Review:
Summary:
Made 260 dollars and first gamethon to make money but less people. For ExtraLife we decided to donate 20 percent which is 55 dollars.

Esports Club: 
Esports had mixed feelings about gamethon and ACM had mixed feelings about esports club.
	Esports thoughts:
		They believed they could beleive they could just let people in to their tourment and not have they pay for the snacks.
	ACM thoughts:
		Esport did not bring anything to the event so that was not good and they did not help clean up. We also had to kick them out at 2am.
	Conclusion:
		ACM need to communicate better with Esport club about expectaions and what is going on. Also we need to have them pitch in as well.
We are planning on sending out a survey about gamethon asking if it was too expensive, if people want the gamrthon longer and to take in any suggestions for net semester.
The idea was brought up have a 24 hour longer gamethon. This was met with mixed reveiws.
	Pros:
	We might get more people over all
	
	Cons:
	-ACM staff will have to take shifts for a member to always be there.
	-We will need more meals and snacks
	- If we buy more food we will have to raise the price and people already compalined about 15 dollars
	
	Questions:
	- we could not ask one professor to stay the whole time. So do we need a faculty there for the whole event.We will ask Terri about that.
We will decide on price and length next semester based on the survey.

For Next Time:
-We will host gaming events
-put an ad in the newspaper
-No PC in CH 1200
-We will try for sponsors again but it will be more than on person reaching out
-We need to check and make sure the room is booked since this gamethon it was not
- we will set up a gamethon planning night in hopes to get more people involved

Concerns
-alot of work for 300 dollars
-This gamethon esports was completly separate for the gamethon

HackThon:
This will be our next big event and it will be our spring kickoff.
Notes:
A hackthon is simlar to gamethon but instead of a game it will be a coding project.
The two ideas we had was
	Professors vs students
		-This is the more popular idea
		- We would handicap professors with a hard version of the same problem
		-Also have a wheel of distractions each team has two tickets and they spin the wheel to figure out what distractionthey will give and could pick anyone
		the other part of this is there is a small percent of the wheel that could backfire on to the spinning team.
	One professor with a team of students
		-We would put names of professors in a hat and each student team pulls a name from a hat to protect from favoritsim.
	Title could be Cutthroat Coding
Pros:
- With this event we will be able to use the leftover snacks from gamethon.

Spring Feild Trip:
ACM wants to do a feild trip in the spring. Usally the faculty is the ones who reachs out to companies. We nee to talk to Dr Hawley and see if we want to do that.
If Dr Hawley does not want to do a feild trip ACM could reach out to companies or just do a tour of Bartik computing museum.

Other thing:
-After we elections when we have a new treasurer. We will move our money off campus and put the new treasurer name on the account.
Once we move our money we will make the donation to ExtraLife.
- We need to really push elections. We will make posters and talk about it in classes. We also need to talk to Rogers about talking to the ACL community.
-Email blast about much we donating from last gamethon and adversting spring gamthon
