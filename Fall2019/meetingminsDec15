Planning hackthon:
Students will watch professors do a Hack-a-thon. To fundaise we will have a wheel of punshments and it will be a dollars to spin
the wheel. The wheel will be spun every 5mins if there are people paying if no one pays the wheel will be spun every 15 mins. On the
wheel we will have a global tile so the attack hits everyone and there will be an immunity tile. The time limit will be an hour. 
Since the time limit we will have a range of questions ranging in difficulty and assign point accordingly.
