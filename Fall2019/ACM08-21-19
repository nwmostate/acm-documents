-----------------------------------------------------Org Fair---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Todo:    We need to ask Rogers to lend us a iot kit, a 3d printer and a pi and hat for our booth.
	We also need to find the ACM trifold

----------------------------------------------------Kickoff-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
We are no longer going todo a sig kickoff but one big kickoff. For the big kickoff we are going to start in CH 1200 and do a welcome speech and then at the end move outside for pieing the professors. The main issue is will the professors want to be pied? When two professors were asked there was mixed reviews. Connor is asking all professor and will find out on the 22nd. If professors say no to being pied it will be the ACM exec bored who will step up and be pied. The price to throw a pie is 3 for one pie or 5 for 2 pies. Vennmo will be accepted. For the event we need to buy cream, poncho, tarp and plates. The amount of each will depend on what professors agree and ACM funds. We will buy cream the day of the kickoff.
 The other thing is we will be offering cookies. The hope is the school will sponsor the cookies but if not ACM might buy the cookies. Connor will check with the school about cookies and will find out the 22nd. To go with the cookies ACM will give away their endless supply of water bottles.
To promote this event Addi is creating a poster that will be email blasted to CSIC students. Connor will go to programming 1 classes and LALC to promote. The exec will promote in their respective classes.

Promote open lab at kickoff and see who is interested

---------------------------------------------------------Fall Gameathon------------------------------------------------------------
Badges: The goal is to buy them a week before the table in the union which is Oct 14- Oct 18 so the badges have to be ordered by Oct 7th. The back of the badges we hope to have sponsors names and logos.
To dos:
Chases has agreed to help look for companies to sponsor the event. Commerce has already agreed but for Chases to succeed someone has to share the numbers from the last gameathon with him.
Since we are supporting Extra life we agreed that it would look good if we had a trifold about gameathon and Extra Life on the union table. We need to make one.
Last year the fighting club now called the esports club was a big draw to the gameathon. We need to get in contact with them and see if they will come again.
Last year we had the Health services promote our event. We would like them to do that this year so Chase has agreed to get in touch with them along with getting on myNorthwest.
We thought it would be a good way to promote if we send someone in to the freshmen university seminar

Notes:
•	Last year we ordered 45 pizzas and split them into two round. The first round was kinda slow but the second round the pizza was gone. 
•	The price for this year is 15 dollar if you buy in early but if you wait till you walk through the door it is going to be 20 dollars. 
•	A thought was setting up streaming for the esports club but we need to check with university on rules on that.
•	An idea was put out about having a raffle at the gameathon. If we do this we need prizes
•	We are setting aside 10 percent of our profit for extra life
•	We are collecting money at the union and giving out badges but what about vennmo?
•	Connor already has or is making the gameathon poster

--------------------------------------------------------------Hoot’s message--------------------------------------------------------

Hoot has set up a Q&A session with the speaker at 3pm. He wants us to invite gamejam participates and others we can think of. There is only 20 people allowed in this group.

----------------------------------------------------Eloe’s Messages--------------------------------------------------------------
•	We are on probation and Dr. Eloe will try to fix but if help Dr. Eloe if he asks and fast.
•	Faculty met with freshman and Dr. Eloe talked to freshman and cultivate interest with them if you see freshmen be welcoming.
•	Faculty want to do an internship poster night. We need to help them to make everyone’s lives easier. Do poster sooner rather than later line it up with career day? Four weeks from now sept 18th.
