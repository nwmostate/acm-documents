Gameathon info
Esport club is coming and gaming club is coming. We know esports will hold a tournament but we do not know how involed gaming club wants to be. Since esports club will be very inolved we will give them two staff badges on for their president and one for thier vice president.
With sponors no one has gotten back to us. So we will assume that we will have no sponsors for this gameathon. It was brought up the we should try senor burrito to sponsor us along with using facebook to get intouch with gameboard cafe. Anothor sponsor we are tracking down is the school of computing science. Chase Smith and Connor have volunteered to reach out to the school.
Union table needs to take careful notes on how much cash comes in and how many badges we sell this will be helped with keeping a name list and how they paid and vennmo. We will use Noah's vennmo. Once we sell the badge we have to remind the purchaser that the badge is their ticket in to the gamethon. This notice will be on the back of the badge.
