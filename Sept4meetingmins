-----------------------------------------------EVENTS COMING UP-------------------------------------------------
Intership poster night -Sept 11th
-----------------------------------------------------NOTES------------------------------------------------------
Today we setup Trello to help with getting everything done for gamethon.
We think it would be a good idea to have a fundraiser at the begnning of next semester.
After pie a professor we have 720 dolllars in the bank.
-----------------------------------------------KICKOFF REVIEW---------------------------------------------------
Pie a Professor was a good fundrasier for us and we definitly want to do it again next year. This year we made 100is dollars.
The professors had alot of fun but a suggestion they had for next  year was they wanted to pie students as well. For next year
we need to buy googles for the professors, remember to bring towels and this year we ought 13 can of whipped cream and we ran out.
---------------------------------------------ORGANIZATION FAIR REVIEW--------------------------------------------
The email list we created at the orgation fair. We need to scan it in and put it on github.
---------------------------------------------INTERSHIP POSTER NIGHT----------------------------------------------
